This is a back-end project template with an initial structure for your projects. This repository can be cloned and modified to meet your needs. 

To clone this repository to your local environment, use the command below:

```

After cloning, change to the directory of the cloned project:

To use this project as a base and not as a synchronized Git repository, remove the `.git` directory to unlink it from the remote repository: 

```bash
